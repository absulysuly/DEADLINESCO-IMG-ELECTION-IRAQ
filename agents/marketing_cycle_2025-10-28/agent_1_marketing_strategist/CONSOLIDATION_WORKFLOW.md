## Consolidation Process

### Phase 1: Data Ingestion
```typescript
// Pseudocode
const eventsData = await loadJSON('../agent_2_event_outreach/events_mock.json');
const candidatesData = await loadJSON('../agent_3_candidate_intelligence/candidates_mock.json');
const contentFiles = await loadDirectory('../agent_4_content_creation/content_queue');
const metricsData = await loadJSON('../agent_5_social_scheduler/social_metrics.json');
const qaReport = await loadMarkdown('../agent_6_integration_qa/integration_summary.md');
```

### Phase 2: Data Aggregation

#### Governorate-Level Aggregation
For each of the 18 governorates, aggregate:
```typescript
interface GovernorateMetrics {
  governorate: string;
  candidates: number;
  events: number;
  contentPosts: number;
  estimatedReach: number;
  avgEngagement: number;
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
}
```

#### Platform-Level Aggregation
```typescript
interface PlatformMetrics {
  platform: 'facebook' | 'twitter' | 'instagram';
  postCount: number;
  totalViews: number;
  avgEngagement: number;
  topPerformingPost: string;
}
```

#### Language-Level Aggregation
```typescript
interface LanguageMetrics {
  language: 'ar' | 'ku';
  postCount: number;
  totalReach: number;
  avgEngagement: number;
  topGovernorates: string[];
}
```

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis

#### Geographic Gaps
```typescript
function identifyGeographicGaps(data: ConsolidatedData): Gap[] {
  const gaps = [];
  
  for (const governorate of ALL_GOVERNORATES) {
    if (data.candidates[governorate] < TARGET_CANDIDATES) {
      gaps.push({
        type: 'candidate_coverage',
        governorate,
        current: data.candidates[governorate],
        target: TARGET_CANDIDATES,
        severity: calculateSeverity(...)
      });
    }
    
    if (data.events[governorate] < TARGET_EVENTS) {
      gaps.push({
        type: 'event_infrastructure',
        governorate,
        current: data.events[governorate],
        target: TARGET_EVENTS,
        severity: calculateSeverity(...)
      });
    }
  }
  
  return gaps;
}
```

#### Content Gaps
```typescript
function identifyContentGaps(data: ConsolidatedData): Gap[] {
  // Check for underutilized platforms
  // Check for language imbalance
  // Check for theme diversity
  // Check for timing optimization
}
```

#### Infrastructure Gaps
```typescript
function identifyInfrastructureGaps(data: ConsolidatedData): Gap[] {
  // Check event category coverage
  // Check venue capacity adequacy
  // Identify missing service types
}
```

### Phase 4: Performance Analysis

#### Top Performers
```typescript
interface TopPerformers {
  governorates: {
    name: string;
    totalReach: number;
    engagementRate: number;
  }[];
  platforms: {
    name: string;
    avgEngagement: number;
  }[];
  contentTypes: {
    type: string;
    avgEngagement: number;
  }[];
}
```

#### Underperformers
Identify areas needing attention:
- Governorates with low engagement
- Platforms with poor performance
- Content themes that don't resonate
- Time slots with weak reach

### Phase 5: Strategic Recommendations

#### Recommendation Generation
```typescript
interface Recommendation {
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  category: 'content' | 'infrastructure' | 'targeting' | 'timing';
  title: string;
  rationale: string;
  actionItems: string[];
  expectedImpact: string;
  resources: string[];
}

function generateRecommendations(analysis: AnalysisResults): Recommendation[] {
  const recommendations = [];
  
  // Example: Geographic targeting
  if (analysis.gaps.governorates.length > 0) {
    recommendations.push({
      priority: 'high',
      category: 'targeting',
      title: 'Increase coverage in underserved governorates',
      rationale: `${analysis.gaps.governorates.length} governorates below target`,
      actionItems: [
        `Add 2 candidates in ${analysis.gaps.governorates.join(', ')}`,
        'Create region-specific content',
        'Identify local event venues'
      ],
      expectedImpact: 'Balanced geographic representation',
      resources: ['Agent 3', 'Agent 4']
    });
  }
  
  // Example: Platform optimization
  if (analysis.topPlatform.engagement > 1.5 * analysis.avgPlatform.engagement) {
    recommendations.push({
      priority: 'medium',
      category: 'content',
      title: `Increase ${analysis.topPlatform.name} content allocation`,
      rationale: `${analysis.topPlatform.name} shows 50% higher engagement`,
      actionItems: [
        `Shift 10% of content budget to ${analysis.topPlatform.name}`,
        'Study top-performing post patterns',
        'Optimize posting times'
      ],
      expectedImpact: '15-20% overall engagement increase',
      resources: ['Agent 4', 'Agent 5']
    });
  }
  
  return recommendations;
}
```

## Data Quality Considerations

### Handling Missing Data
```typescript
function handleMissingData(agentId: string, expectedFile: string) {
  logger.warn(`Missing input from ${agentId}: ${expectedFile}`);
  
  // Flag in report
  report.warnings.push({
    severity: 'high',
    message: `${agentId} output not available`,
    impact: 'Incomplete analysis',
    action: 'Run ${agentId} before next consolidation'
  });
  
  // Continue with partial analysis
  return { status: 'partial', missingAgent: agentId };
}
```

### Validating Data Integrity
```typescript
function validateDataIntegrity(data: AgentOutput) {
  // Check timestamp freshness
  const age = Date.now() - new Date(data.timestamp).getTime();
  if (age > MAX_DATA_AGE_MS) {
    logger.warn(`Stale data from ${data.agentSignature}`);
  }
  
  // Verify agent signature
  if (!data.agentSignature.startsWith('Agent')) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid agent signature: ${data.agentSignature}`);
  }
  
  // Check data completeness
  if (data.records && data.records.length === 0) {
    logger.warn(`No records from ${data.agentSignature}`);
  }
}
```
