## Processing Logic

### Phase 1: Data Ingestion
1. Read all input files from other agents
2. Validate data completeness and structure
3. Log any missing or corrupted data

### Phase 2: Aggregation
1. Group candidates by governorate
2. Map events to governorate categories
3. Link content to governorate targets
4. Aggregate metrics by platform and location

### Phase 3: Analysis
1. Calculate coverage ratios (candidates per governorate)
2. Identify event infrastructure gaps
3. Analyze content distribution balance
4. Assess engagement patterns

### Phase 4: Strategy Formulation
1. Prioritize governorates needing attention
2. Recommend content themes based on gaps
3. Suggest platform optimization
4. Define next-cycle objectives

### Phase 5: Report Generation
1. Generate markdown report with insights
2. Create visual-ready data summaries
3. Output actionable recommendations

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Successfully ingests data from all 5 dependent agents
- ✅ Provides strategic insights for all 18 governorates
- ✅ Identifies at least 3 actionable recommendations
- ✅ Report generated within 2 minutes of execution
- ✅ All outputs include proper timestamps and signatures

## Error Handling

- Highlight data integrity concerns
- Recommend data validation actions

## Integration Points

### With Backend (Future)
- Strategy reports can be stored in database
- Insights feed into dashboard analytics
- Recommendations trigger automated workflows

### With Other Agents
- Influences next-cycle content themes (Agent 4)
- Guides event outreach priorities (Agent 2)
- Informs candidate research focus (Agent 3)

## Execution Command (Conceptual)

npm run agent:strategist
# or
node dist/agents/agent_1_marketing_strategist/index.js
```

## Notes
