Summary
remove duplicate React import usage in TopNavBar to prevent identifier collisions
add a comprehensive PowerShell maintenance script and accompanying MVP validation checklist
drop Tailwind CDN usage, track Next.js env typings, and add i18next dependency with .next ignored in git
Testing
npm run lint (prompts for configuration and requires manual selection)
npm run build (fails offline when fetching Google Fonts and due to missing registry access for i18next prior to install)
