# DEPLOYMENT ISSUE DIAGNOSIS

## Current Status (as of check)

### Backend (Render)
**Status:** ❌ NOT DEPLOYED
- Response: `404 Not Found`
- Header: `x-render-routing: no-server`
- **Meaning:** Render service is not running - deployment didn't start or failed

### Frontend (Vercel)  
**Status:** ❌ ERROR
- Response: `500 Internal Server Error`
- Error: `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED`
- **Meaning:** Middleware error on Vercel (i18n redirect logic)

---

## IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

### Fix 1: Manually Deploy on Render

**The Render deployment didn't auto-deploy from GitHub push.**

**ACTION REQUIRED:**
1. Open: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d3ra4p24d50c73bksgdg
2. Look at the "Events" or "Logs" tab - check if deployment failed
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"** → **"Deploy latest commit"**
4. Monitor the logs - watch for errors
5. Wait for "Build successful" message

**Common Render Issues:**
- Build timeout (free tier has limits)
- Missing dependencies
- Port configuration

---

### Fix 2: Check Vercel Deployment Logs

The middleware error might be due to:
- Missing environment variables
- Build error
- Dependency issues

**ACTION:**
1. Open: https://vercel.com/absulysulys-projects/test-new-frontend
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click "View Function Logs" or "Build Logs"
4. Look for errors related to:
   - `@formatjs/intl-localematcher`
   - `negotiator`
   - `i18n-config`

**If you see module errors:**
The deployment might not have all dependencies. Check if `package.json` was pushed correctly.

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS

### Test Backend
```powershell
# Should return {"status":"ok"}
curl https://srv-d3ra4p24d50c73bksgdg.onrender.com/health

# Should return candidate data
curl https://srv-d3ra4p24d50c73bksgdg.onrender.com/api/candidates?limit=3
```

### Test Frontend
```powershell
# Should return 200 OK (not 500)
curl -I https://amlet-unified.vercel.app

# Should redirect to /en or /ar (not error)
curl -L https://amlet-unified.vercel.app
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS

### If Render Deployment Fails:

**Check Render Dashboard → Events/Logs for:**
1. Build errors
2. Start command errors  
3. Port binding errors

**Common Fixes:**
- Ensure `backend/package.json` exists
- Ensure `backend/server.mjs` exists
- Check `rootDir: backend` in render.yaml

### If Vercel Middleware Fails:

**Option A: Disable Middleware Temporarily**
Comment out middleware redirect to test:

```typescript
// export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
//   ...
// }
```

**Option B: Check Dependencies**
Ensure these are in `package.json`:
- `@formatjs/intl-localematcher`
- `negotiator`
- `@types/negotiator`

---

## WHAT TO DO NOW

### Step 1: Check Render Dashboard
Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d3ra4p24d50c73bksgdg/events

**Look for:**
- Recent deployment activity
- Error messages
- Build status

**Take action:**
- If no deployment: Click "Manual Deploy"
- If failed: Share error message
- If building: Wait for completion

### Step 2: Check Vercel Dashboard  
Go to: https://vercel.com/absulysulys-projects/test-new-frontend

**Click latest deployment → View logs**

**Look for:**
- Build errors
- Function errors
- Missing modules

---

## NEXT STEPS BASED ON WHAT YOU SEE

**If Render shows "Build Failed":**
→ Share the error log so I can fix the issue

**If Vercel shows "Missing module":**
→ We may need to redeploy with correct dependencies

**If both are building/deploying:**
→ Wait 2-3 minutes then test again

---

## Quick Test After You Manual Deploy

Run this:
```powershell
timeout /t 120 && curl https://srv-d3ra4p24d50c73bksgdg.onrender.com/health
```

This waits 2 minutes then tests the backend.

**Please check the Render dashboard and tell me what you see in the Events/Logs tab!**
