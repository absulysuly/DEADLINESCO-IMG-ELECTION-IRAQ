## 🔧 PROBLEMS FOUND & FIXED

### Problem 1: Wrong Backend URL
**Issue:** Frontend was calling `srv-d3ra4p24d50c73bksgdg.onrender.com` (doesn't exist)  
**Reality:** Backend is at `hamlet-complete-mvp-2.onrender.com`  
**Fix:** ✅ Updated `.env.production` with correct URL

### Problem 2: CORS Blocking
**Issue:** Backend wasn't allowing Vercel domain  
**Fix:** ✅ Updated CORS whitelist in `server.mjs`

### Problem 3: Tailwind CSS Not Loading
**Issue:** Missing `import './globals.css'` in root layout  
**Fix:** ✅ Added import statement

### Problem 4: Vercel Middleware Error
**Issue:** i18n middleware failing (500 error)  
**Status:** 🔍 Investigating - may resolve with correct backend connection
